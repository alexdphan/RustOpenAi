# RustOpenAi ðŸ¤–

--- 

A CLI application in which integrates [OpenAI's](https://openai.com/api/) GPT-3 API using Rust

---

### Spent a couple hours building this during my free time

I wanted to play with AI a bit, while also getting some practice with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

OpenAI had some [models](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/overview) I could try out while using some free credits.

All I had to do was decide on a [use case](https://beta.openai.com/examples/)...

### My use case was... To troll my friends lol

It was fun to send them wierd messages, but hopefully I'll expand more on this project during my free time.

## How to Use

1. Clone/Fork this repo
   
2. Get an [API secret key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) from OpenAI
   
3. Go to your terminal and set OAI_TOKEN=YOUR_API_KEY

4. Modify the premble variable to display how you want the AI to respond 
   
5. Type "Cargo Run"
   
6. Ask any question and have fun :D
