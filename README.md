# RustOpenAi ðŸ¤–

--- 

A CLI application in which integrates [OpenAI's](https://openai.com/api/) GPT-3 API using Rust

---

I wanted to play with AI a bit, while also getting some practice with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

OpenAI had some [models](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/overview) I could try out while using some free credits.

All I had to do was decide on a [use case](https://beta.openai.com/examples/)...

### My use case was... To troll my friends lol
